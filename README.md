# This web application is composed by:
A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging).
A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
A database or files that store data (data = objects).
An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them).
